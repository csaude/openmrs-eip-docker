# Routes

####dead-letter-channel-route.xml
Route to receive all messages in error. Default configuration logs messages, but any other Camel endpoint can be use to handle error messages

######calling routes
all routes

######outgoing routes
None

####outbound-complex-obs-route.xml
Route that reads the content of the directory passed as input via spring the property *camel.output.endpoint.complex.obs.data.directory*.
The files are marshalled to Base64 and the resulting content is appended with *<FILE>* at the beginning and *</FILE>* at the end. This allows the receiver side of the sync process to differenciate complex obs files and entities.
The resulting strings corresponding to the files are then passed to a Camel endpoint that can be for instance a JMS queue or a File endpoint.

It is possible to encrypt the message before dispatching it via the processor *pgpEncryptService*.

######calling routes

######calling routes
None, Trigger of the sync process

######outgoing route
select-route.xml

####select-route.xml
Route that receives as a message the table synchronize with the last sync date of that table and uses the OpenMRS Camel component to get all the modified data after that date.
The entities corresponding to the table extracted are then passed to a Camel endpoint that can be for instance a JMS queue or a File endpoint.
This route also saves the current date as the last sync date for the current table via the processor *saveSyncStatusProcessor*.

It is possible to encrypt the message before dispatching it via the processor *pgpEncryptService*.
